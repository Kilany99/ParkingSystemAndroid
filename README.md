- **Maintainability:** Simplified data binding and state management.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Framework:** Android (using Android Jetpack components)
- **Architecture Components:** LiveData, ViewModel, and Navigation Component
- **Networking:** Retrofit (for API communication)
- **Local Storage:** Room Database (if local caching or offline capabilities are needed)
- **UI Libraries:** Material Design Components, custom UI components inspired by Kendo UI for Angular
- **Build Tool:** Gradle
